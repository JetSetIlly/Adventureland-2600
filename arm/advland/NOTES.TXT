The port of ADVEN1.BAS to ADVLAND.C+ADVLAND.H was done for fun, and was not
intended for publication. Errors may (or may not) occur during play. However,
I have completed the game several times, and it plays ok to my knowledge.

I do not take any responsibilities for any damages which may occur if you
choose to use the included files.

The files were compiled by Borland Turbo C version 2.0, and compiles without
warnings with standard settings.

If you modify this program, or use part of it in your own code, please mail
me a copy.
